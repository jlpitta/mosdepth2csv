# Description
"Mosdepth2csv" is a script developed to process and interpret files named "thresholds.bed.gz" generated by the mosdepth tool, which is configured with the '--threshold' parameter. The purpose of this script is to extract relevant information from these files and transform it into CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. Subsequently, these CSV files are bundled and compressed into a zip file for more convenient storage or distribution. This script serves as a tool for converting and organizing data outputted by mosdepth into a more accessible and manageable format.

# Usage:

To use mosdepth, first download the script via git clone:
```
git clone
